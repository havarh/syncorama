MANUAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
==============================

Since you are not using Composer, you must install the WebAuthn library manually.

1. Download the library from GitHub:
   https://github.com/lbuchs/WebAuthn/archive/master.zip

2. Extract the ZIP file.

3. Locate the `src` folder inside the extracted archive.

4. Upload the CONTENTS of the `src` folder to `lib/lbuchs/WebAuthn/` on your server.

   Your file structure should look like this:
   /syncorama
     /api.php
     /lib
       /lbuchs
         /WebAuthn
           /WebAuthn.php
           /WebAuthnException.php
           /Binary
             /ByteBuffer.php
           /Attestation
             ...
           /CBOR
             ...
           ...

5. Once uploaded, the application will work automatically.
